NAME
       env - set temporary environment and execute a command,  or  print envi-
       ronment


SYNOPSIS
       env [-iv] [[-u KEY] ...] [KEY=value ...] [utility [arguments ...]]


DESCRIPTION
       The env built-in executes another utility after modifying the  environ-
       ment  as  specified by the command line.  Each name=value option speci-
       fies the setting of an environment variable,  name,  with  a  value  of
       value.	All these  environment variables are set before the utility is
       executed.


OPTIONS
       -i

       Execute the utility with only given environment variables specified  by
       name=value  options.   The environment inherited by env is ignored com-
       pletely.

       -u name

       If the environment variable name is in the environment, then remove  it
       before  processing  the remaining options. This is similar to the unset
       command in sh(1). The value for name must not include the  `='  charac-
       ter.

       -v

       Print  verbose informations for each step of processing done by the env
       utility.


       The above options are only recognized when they	are  specified	before
       any  name=value options. If no utility is specified, env prints out the
       names and  values  of  the  variables  in  the  environment,  with  one
       name/value pair per line.


ENVIRONMENT
       The  env  utility  uses	the  PATH  environment	variable to locate the
       requested utility if the name contains no `/'characters, unless the  -P
       option has been specified.


EXIT STATUS
       This utility exits 0 on success and >0 if an error occurs.

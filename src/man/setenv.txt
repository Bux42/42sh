NAME
       setenv


SYNOPSIS
       setenv [KEY[=value]] [overwrite] - Add KEY to the environment


DESCRIPTION
       This  utility  add  one	KEY to the environment or modify its  value if
       it already exists. It also add a value to this key if one is specified.
       If no argument provided, the environment is written on standard output.
       If a "0" overwrite  (int)  is  specified,  the value of the KEY doesn't
       change if it already exists. If it doesn't exist, the value is created.
       If the overwrite is different from "0", the behavior of  the builtin is
       the same as without overwrite.


OPTIONS
       None.


EXIT STATUS
       The setenv utility exits 0 on success and >0 if an error occurs.


EXAMPLE
       To add "CAT" to the environment with the key "Norminet" only if the key
       doesn't already exists:

       $setenv CAT=Norminet 0
